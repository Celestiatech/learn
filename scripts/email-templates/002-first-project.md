Subject: Your first project — build something today

Hi — ready for a short project?

Try the Mini Todo project. It takes about 30–60 minutes and combines HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Steps:

1. Open the Todo project lesson in your dashboard.
2. Fork the starter and run it in the playground.
3. Add the features: add item, mark complete, and remove.

When you finish, share the link or save it as a gist — we love seeing learner projects.

Keep going,
