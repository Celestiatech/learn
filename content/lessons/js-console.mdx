# JavaScript Console

Learn how to print to the console, inspect values, and run small scripts in the playground.

```js
// Try this in the playground editor and press Run
const name = 'Learner'
console.log('Hello,', name)

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b
}

console.log('2 + 3 =', add(2,3))
```

### Micro-challenge

Modify `name` so the greeting reads: `Hello, <your-name> — welcome!`.

When you're done, continue to the DOM lesson to manipulate the page itself.
