# CSS Basics

> In this lesson you'll learn the essentials to start styling HTML: selectors, colors, spacing, and simple layout.

## Demo

Try this CSS in the playground or add it to your HTML file:

```html
/* Add to a <style> block or a CSS file */
body {
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial;
  background: #f8fafc;
  color: #0f172a;
}

.card {
  background: white;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(2,6,23,0.06);
}
```

## What you'll learn

- CSS selectors and specificity
- Colors and spacing
- Using classes to reuse styles

### Micro-challenge

Change the `.card` background to a soft blue and add a 1px border. Press Run.

When you're done, move to the next lesson to learn a bit of JavaScript.
