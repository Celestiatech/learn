Developer notes & next steps

1) Install dependencies and run locally

```powershell
cd i:\learn\learning-site
npm install
npm run dev
```

2) What I scaffolded
- Next.js app with TypeScript
- MDX support via `@next/mdx`
- Tailwind config and PostCSS
- A sample MDX lesson and a Monaco-based playground page

3) Next things I can implement (pick one):
- Add NextAuth with GitHub/Google and a simple SQLite+Prisma setup for progress tracking
- Build a small admin UI for creating lessons (or integrate Sanity/Strapi)
- Add unit tests, ESLint and GitHub Actions

If you'd like me to run `npm install` and start the dev server now I can attempt it in this environment (I'll run it from the project folder and report the output)."}
